Adelajda is Android app designed for flashcard learning.
It targets API 31.

Adelajda allows user to create multiple lists, where each item contains a pair of words in two languages, and optionally a comment and background color information for the item.
Both the list information (name and languages names) and the list item content can be edited. A list or an item can also be deleted.
Lists are stored in app's internal storage.

Adelajda offers two learning modes:
A) The app displays a word in one language, and after user clicks the "reveal" button, its translation is shown.
The user can chose whether to display, at the beginning the word from the first, second, or both languages.
B) The app displays a word in one language, user can enter its translation into EditText box, and check if it is correct.
As in mode A the user can chose whether to display, at the beginning the word from the first, second, or both languages.
Additionally, the user can decide whether, after misspelling a word, it should be skipped, repeated immediately, or repeated before the end of list.
